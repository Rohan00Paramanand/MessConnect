# 🍽️ MessConnect (Currently ongoing)

MessConnect is a transparency-focused platform designed to bridge the gap between students, mess vendors, and the mess committee faculty.
Its goal is to improve accountability, food quality, and communication within institutional mess systems.

## 🚀 Project Overview

MessConnect provides a centralized system where:

- Vendors can manage staff and publish weekly food timetables

- Students can submit geotagged feedback with photos and videos
